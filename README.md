- **Search by folders** - Shows you a list of all the largest folders in the specified directory
- **Folders and sub folders** - Shows you a list of both, all the largest files and folders in the specified directory

## File Search

- **Search files by content** - reads all of the files in a directory, looks at the files contents too see if it contains the specified phrase. Useful if you have for example forgotten the name of a file, but you know that it contains a specific word.
- **Search files by name** - shows a list of files, whose name matches the specified phrase.

## Manage Files

- **Remove duplicate files by hash** - looks for duplicate files by generating a hash of each file in a directory and then comparing the hashes.
